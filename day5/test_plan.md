# How to Write a Test Plan

		Test plans outline the process of testing the functionality of software. A test plan details each step taken to achieve a certain result and states the objective of each action. The plan also highlights the projected resources, risks, and personnel involved in the test. You should use a test plan if you are seeking to eliminate bugs and other errors in your software before it becomes available to customers. Follow the steps below to create a test plan.
	
# Introduction

		An introduction includes a general description and schedule of a test, as well as any related documents. 

		A document description provides an overall mission statement, covering the methods that will be used in the testing process and the projected results. Related documents include any peripheral material that is relevant to the current project, such as lists of specifications. A schedule details the increments of time in which each phase of the test will be completed.
