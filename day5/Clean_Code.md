*Robert Cecil Martin*, known colloquially as "Uncle Bob", is an American software consultant and author. Martin has been a software professional since 1970 and an international software consultant since 1990. In 2001, he initiated the meeting of the group that created agile software development from extreme programming techniques. He is also a leading member of the software craftsmanship movement. His video "code casts" on the Clean Coders website can be purchased on www.cleancoders.com. He founded Object Mentor Inc., a consulting firm that specializes in training their clients in C++, Java, OOP, patterns, UML, agile methodologies, and extreme programming. From 1996 to 1999 he was the editor-in-chief of the C++ Report. In 2002 he wrote Agile Software Development: Principles, Patterns, and Practices, which gives pragmatic advice on object-oriented design and development in an agile team.

# My comments

*	mostly on the coding level as suggested by the title
*	Java is the programming language in the examples
*	concurrent programming is too hard
*	chapter 17 is the summary or check list
*	better organized in terms of bibliography and links in the pdf file 
*	verbose somehow

# 6	Objects and Data Structures

*	Data Abstraction
*	Data/Object Anti-Symmetry

		Procedural code (code using data structures) makes it easy to add new functions without changing the existing data structures. OO code, on the other hand, makes it easy to add new classes without changing existing functions.
		
		Procedural code makes it hard to add new data structures because all the functions must change. OO code makes it hard to add new functions because all the classes must change.

*	The Law of Demeter <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_Demeter>

*	Use Unchecked Exceptions
*	Provide Context with Exceptions
*	Define Exception Classes in Terms of a Caller’s Needs
*	Define the Normal Flow
*	Don’t Return Null
*	Don’t Pass Null

# 9 Unit Tests

*	The Three Laws of TDD

	-	You may not write production code until you have written a failing unit test.
	-	You may not write more of a unit test than is sufficient to fail, and not compiling is failing.
	-	You may not write more production code than is sufficient to pass the cur- rently failing test.
	
*	Keeping Tests Clean

		Test code is just as important as production code.
		
*	Tests Enable the -ilities
*	Clean Tests
*	Domain-Specific Testing Language
*	A Dual Standard
*	One Assert per Test
*	Single Concept per Test
*	F.I.R.S.T.

	-	Fast
	-	Independent
	-	Repeatable
	-	Self-Validating
	-	Timely

# 12 Emergence
		by Jeff Langr

*	Getting Clean via Emergent Design

	-	Contains no duplication
	-	Expresses the intent of the programmer
	-	Minimizes the number of classes and methods
