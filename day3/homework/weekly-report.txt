Weekly Report of September 23, GPBOX project

Summary:

In this week, I prototyped a python wrapper for BCDS (Baidu Cloud Disk Service).


Completed:


1. Investigate the authorization and authentification mechanism of BCDS.
2. Choose python-oauth2 as the OAuth client lib.
3. Implemented our python library called 'PyBCDS' to make interacting with BCDS much more easily.
4. Test basic functionalities of PyBCDS.
5. (Misc) Designed a logo for GPBOX.


To-Do:


1. Add unit tests for PyBCDS to make the code coverage no less than 80%.
2. Write documentation for PyBCDS.
3. Work with John Doe on GPBOX web backend.


Issues/Comments:

1. BCDS limits its client's API calls to 500 times/day, which is only enough for development. We should apply for an upgraded account when put GPBOX into production.
