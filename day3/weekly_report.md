# Weekly Report

A weekly report allows companies to track employee progress at all levels. Entry-level employees can submit weekly reports to their supervisors, and middle management can inform executives about weekly accomplishments. Weekly reports help projects remain on schedule and employees complete required tasks. In addition, weekly reports help supervisors when it is time for performance reviews because they document an employee’s accomplishments.

1. Include the heading. Your heading should include the words “Weekly Report,” the employee’s name and the date of the report at a minimum. Other items to consider including in the heading are your supervisor’s name or your team (such as “Sales Team").

2. Write a brief summary. Precede this section by the heading “Summary,” and include a few sentences that summarize your work for the week. This summary gives your supervisor a general overview of your tasks for the week.

3. List accomplished tasks. Highlight the work you accomplished during the week under the “Accomplishments” heading. Here, you can include any important meetings that took place or decisions that you made. For example, if you’re a public relations professional, you would want to include the number of press releases you distributed for the week and the media attention that your clients received. Focus on accomplishments that contribute to company goals or move a project toward completion.

4. Explain in-progress tasks. Let your supervisor know what tasks you’re still working on. Include how much of the task is complete, such as 50 percent, and list the anticipated finish date. If there is a deadline for the task, include that date, and indicate whether you will be able to complete the task in time.

5. Identify next week’s goals. Your goals for the following week should include any items that you list in the “In Progress” section. Identify any meetings or events scheduled for the next week as well.

Whether you're writing a weekly report, a trip report, a progress report, or a simple memo, certain principles will give your writing more punch and get you noticed.

*	Find out what format your organization normally uses for whatever kind of report you're writing. Some companies uses memos for weekly reports, while others have special forms.

*	Be aware of the typical "fate" of your report. Many reports are just filed for reference and never read. If you have something important to tell, a standard report form might not be the best choice. When an accident almost caused a nuclear disaster at the Three Mile Island power plant, the investigation found that an engineer had foreseen the problem and written it up. But he wrote it as part of a standard trip report on a visit he had made to another power plant. It was filed away, and no one ever read it. If there's something important that you really want people to read, put it up front in **big, bold letters**!

*	Use headings to make it easier for your reader to find important pieces of information and to make the main points stand out.

*	Use lists- numbered for items in decreasing order of importance, or bulleted for items of equal weight. Lists break up dense paragraphs and make your report easier to scan.

*	Use powerful verbs. In studies of how people read, researchers found that readers remember the verbs (the actions) more than anything else in what they've read.[1] Make sure that the real action is in the verb. For example:

	-	"There are several steps that need to be taken" is weak.
	
	-	"We need to take several steps" is much stronger.
	
	-	"Your attention is invited to the attached document" is weak. There's no inviting going on \-\- this is not a party!
	
	-	"Please read the attached document" is better.
	
	-	"The attached document contains information on ..." is even better-- it tells the reader what to expect in the attachment.
	
*	Whenever possible, make the doer of the action the subject of the verb. There are times when for political or diplomatic reasons you might not want to reveal who is doing what to whom, but readers process the information better and remember it longer if you're clear about the relationships. For example:

	-	"Expenses were mistakenly charged to the wrong account" is weak.
	
	-	"The computer mistakenly charged the expenses to the wrong account" is clearer, but most readers find blaming things on a computer to be cowardly.
	
	-	"I mistakenly charged some expenses to the wrong account" is much better. Taking responsibility and fixing problems is usually seen as a strength, not a weakness.
	
*	End with the "so what?" What was the main accomplishment of the week, or the main observation on a trip, or the steps remaining if you're reporting progress. Let your reader take away the impression that something more happened than the passage of another week or work.
