# Status Report

When tackling a large scale project, one of the most important things to do is keep your team informed of the status of your work. This can be accomplished by writing status reports. These reports provide an overview of the project itself, what you have accomplished and what work remains to be completed. Follow these tips for writing a status report.

1. Ensure that you have clearly defined goals for the project. Since large projects involve many people and resources, you want to be sure your report covers how these people and resources are working toward that goal. The best way to do that is to be sure you understand the big picture before you begin.

2. Verify the required format for the report and the time period it should cover. Status reports can be created as formal reports or as more informal communications like emails. Check with your management team or the group requesting the report to determine how often the status report needs to be created and to make sure it is formatted correctly.

3. Begin the report by providing a general overview of the project and what steps your team has accomplished as of the reporting date. Be sure to mention any problems or issues you have encountered and how you have resolved them.

4. Discuss the next steps you plan to take on the project, including both proposed time frames and any changes to the original project plan or budget. It is helpful to include how these actions will help accomplish the overall goals of the project.

5. End the report on a positive note by including a statement of confidence in your team's ability to complete the project successfully and on time. Include contact information and an offer to follow up to personally discuss the report in more detail.

When your boss asks you for a status report, you may feel like shrugging it off. A progress report might seem like something minor but it can go a long way in communicating the details of a project to both your supervisor and other staff members. Providing this information can help your boss assist you with staffing, budgetary needs, support and guidance throughout the project.

*	Research the aspects of your business that you need to cover in your progress report. This includes all details of the project you're working on; you will need to know it inside and out so you can present it to your superiors. Collect reports from subordinates, peers, contractors and sub\-contractors as needed.

*	Compose your statement of purpose. This should include a brief description of the project. You don't need to be wordy as supervisors should have some information on what you're working on and they probably have limited time to read through progress reports. In this opening statement, explain why you are giving a progress report at this time.

*	Explain what work has already been completed in the body of the report. You can go into more detail here so your boss can relay this information to other parties if necessary. Outline how these tasks will help accomplish the end goal and explain what stage each task is in. Discuss how you're doing with your budget, being specific as to what items are coming in on budget and which ones aren't.

*	Consider any problems you've run into while working on this project. This could include personnel, time constraints, bottlenecks and legal matters. List these along with how you've corrected them or how you plan to correct them. If you need help with something, state it here.

*	Write about what activities are still underway. Provide a projected date of completion for them and outline any potential problems you foresee. Note in the report whether you believe the project will be finished on schedule.

*	Create a spreadsheet detailing what parts of the project are done and which ones you're still working on. Give as much detail as possible; include dates as well as actual and projected costs. Since your boss may not have a lot of time to read progress reports, providing a summary in graph form may help. This is optional but it can really be helpful if your boss is short on time or if he prefers to see things graphically instead of in words.

*	Summarize your status report. Make this section short and concise, giving just the necessary details about what you've completed and what is still left to do. Quickly review any problems or concerns you have with the project and make recommendations on how to correct them.

# How to write a status report

1. Name and date the report. 

	A name containing the date (ex. “Summary for the Week of December 1”) is an easy, efficient option. Be sure to date the report.

		Summary for the Week of December 1

	-	If this report will be an email, you can use this as the subject line.
	
	-	If the report will be a standalone document, place a header with this information on top.

2. Provide details identifying the project. 

	These include the project/assignment title, the starting and/or ending date, and the names of the people who have worked on it.

		Wayne Manor Spring Cleaning Project
		
3. Explain what has been accomplished. 

	Use a heading such as "Accomplishments," "Completed Tasks," "Completed Action Items," or even simply "Done."

		Completed:
		• Finished initial dusting of west wing
		• Removed furnishings from main ballroom
		• Obtained permission from Alfred to repair brickwork in east study
		• Ordered new frames for windows facing east courtyard
		• Replaced all fluorescent bulbs with energy-efficient LEDs
		• Fixed broken grandfather clock in study

	-	Be sure to specify the reporting period (i.e. week, month, quarter, etc.).
	
	-	Use active verbs to start the sentences. These include words like completed, defined, solved, designed, organized, improved, fixed, and filed, to name a few examples.

	-	For a brief weekly report, 3 to 6 one-sentence bullet points may be enough.
	
4. List what will be done during the next reporting period. 

	A good heading for this new section is "Planned tasks", "Next Steps", or "To Do."

		To-Do:
		• Sweep and wax all floor surfaces
		• Refinish wood floors in main ballroom
		• Replace crumbling bricks in east study
		• Replace frames for windows facing east courtyard
		• Order new solar panels to replace broken ones (grid 4-24)
		• Go over revised budget with Alfred
		• Repave entryway
		• Test structural integrity of south wing
		
	-	Estimate the amount of time a task will require, if you can do so confidently. Ex. "Document the bracket design change. (Estimated time: 2 days)."

	-	Refer to any schedules you have been given.

	-	Again, 3 to 6 lines should be enough for a brief report.
	
5. Discuss any problems or potential problems. 

	This is where you should clarify any need for guidance or help. "Open Issues" or "Issues and Comments" are good headers for this section, which can be a short paragraph or two.

		Issues/Comments:
		• Power leak determined to originate somewhere in south wing; electrician to be called in
		• Flue in east room fireplace broken and will need to be replaced
		• Thanks to Jessica for providing a full dinner for the staff who volunteered to stay after hours to complete the bulb replacements
		
	-	Perhaps you're having trouble reaching a supplier because nobody is in the office this week. Perhaps you have a suggestion on how to improve the way the business is run. These are the kinds of details you’ll want to include in this section.

	-	If you are simply reporting the problem and don't require assistance at this point, say so. Comments such as "We expect to solve this issue within the next 2 days" let supervisors know that they do not need to get involved but should monitor the situation.

	-	If a situation does not get resolved, your supervisor cannot complain that you did not inform him/her earlier.
