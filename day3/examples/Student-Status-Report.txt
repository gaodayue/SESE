Casey, Lindsey, Jacob, and Terry 


Done


1. Interviews with leading city and county officials
2. Web research
3. Documentation of Web research, including formatting
4. All of Pleasantville photos 
5. Soil samples from around Pleasant River collected
6. Soil samples from other sites on opposite end of city limits collected 
7. Permits filed for access to sealed city records


To-Do


1. Interviews with state officials, if possible
2. Book research from titles at local library
3. Photos of Danville city limits—photos of Danville itself look to be impossible, due to entry restrictions 
4. Soil samples from Danville, which faces similar problems as the above but may be a bit easier to get 
5. Comparison of fish from this area as opposed to those from rivers several counties away 
6. Freedom of Information Act request filing for governmental documents 




Concerns/Questions


1. If we are indeed barred from Danville and aren’t allowed to get photos/interviews, what do we do? 
2. Cost of filing certain documents getting out of hand for school project
3. Weight of grade, especially given point one 
4. Fish comparisons: if we can’t catch fish, what do we do?
5. State (or higher) official interviews: Have been told implicitly a few times we shouldn’t be “snooping around.” One guy called us “meddling kids.” Afraid of out-of-school trouble
6. Soil sample from Pleasantville growing some weird grass/mold stuff that appears to be moving of its own volition
