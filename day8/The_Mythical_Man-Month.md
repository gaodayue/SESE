# About the author

![](../pic/federick-p-brooks.jpg)

*Frederick P.Brooks, Jr.* won the Turing Award in 1999 for "landmark contributions to computer architecture, operating systems, and software engineering."

He was the manager for the development of the System/360 family of computers and the OS/360 software package. He later wrote candidly about the process in his seminal book The Mythical Man-Month.

# Review

	Few books on software project management have been as influential and timeless as The Mythical Man-Month. With a blend of software engineering facts and thought-provoking opinions, Fred Brooks offers insight for anyone managing complex projects. These essays draw from his experience as project manager for the IBM System/360 computer family and then for OS/360, its massive software system. Now, 20 years after the initial publication of his book, Brooks has revisited his original ideas and added new thoughts and advice, both for readers already familiar with his work and for readers discovering it for the first time.

	-	To believe a program
	-	To modify a program
		-	components of such an overview
		-	A flow chart or subprogram structure graph. More on this later.
		-	Complete descriptions of the algorithms used, or else references to such descriptions in the literature.
		-	An explanation of the layout of all files used.
		-	An overview of the pass structure \-\- The sequence in which data or programs are brought from tape or disk \-\- and what is accomplished on each pass.
		-	A discussion of modifications contemplated in the original design, the nature and location of hooks and exits, and discursive discussion of the ideas of the original author about what modifications might be desirable and how one might proceed. His observations on hidden pitfalls are also useful.

# 16 No Silver Bullet- Essence and Accident in Software Engineering

*	Abstract

	-	Suggestions:

		-	Exploiting the mass market to avoid constructing what can be bought.
		-	Using rapid prototyping as part of a planned iteration in es- tablishing software requirements.
		-	Growing software organically, adding more and more func- tion to systems as they are run, used, and tested.
		-	Identifying and developing the great conceptual designers of the rising generation.

*	Introduction

*	Does It Have to Be Hard? \-\- Essential Difficulties

	-	Complexity
	-	Conformity
	-	Changeability
	-	Invisibility

*	Past Breakthroughs Solved Accidental Difficulties

	-	Time-sharing
	-	Unified programming environments

*	Hopes for the Silver

	-	Object-orientedprogramming
	-	Artificial intelligence
	-	Expert systems
	-	"Automatic" programming
	-	Graphical programming
	-	Program verification
	-	Environments and tools
	-	Workstations

*	Promising Attacks on the Conceptual Essence

	-	Requirements refinement and rapid prototyping
	-	Incremental development
	-	Great designers
	
	A little retrospection shows that although many fine, useful software systems have been designed by committees and built by multipart projects, those software systems that have excited passionate fans are those that are the products of one or a few designing minds, great designers. Consider Unix, APL, Pascal, Modula, the Smalltalk interface, even Fortran; and contrast with Cobol, PL/I, Algol, MVS/370, and MS-DOS.
