Elon Musk: 钢铁侠传奇人生
Elon Musk Profiled: Bloomberg Risk Takers

我小时候很怕黑
When I was a little kid, I was really scared at the dark.

后来我明白
But then I sort of came to understand, OK, well,

黑暗只是缺少光
dark just means really the absence of photons

缺少400到700纳米的可见光
in the visible wavelength, 400 to 700nanometers.

Elon的母亲Maye Musk
Elon's mother, Maye Musk

Elon说黑暗不过是没有光
And Elon said darkness is merely the absence of light.

我觉得害怕没有光这件事很傻
then I thought oh it's really silly to be afraid of the lack of photon.

后来我就不怕黑了
Then I was not afraid of dark anymore, after that.

一次一个小伙伴对他说
Once, one of the kids said to him,

看月亮, 它离我们有十亿英里远
Look at the moon, it's billion miles away.

Elon却说: 不, 其实不到25万英里
And he said, oh, no. It's actually under 250,000 miles away.

小伙伴都惊呼"Elon"
And they said, "Oh,Elon!"

Elon Musk出生在南非

His father was an engineer. His mother's a model and nutritionist.

Elon天资聪慧
Elon got up to a fast start,

比同龄人早一年上学
and began school a year early.

他是班上最小的孩子, 个子也最矮
He was the youngest made by two days and the shortest.

但却最聪明
And then he was this brilliant boy,

因此大家都不怎么喜欢他
and so people don't really like him

我是个小书呆子, 还喜欢苦笑 
So I was this little book wormy kid, and poorly bitter smile alike.

实在不招人喜欢
So this is praecipe for disaster.

虽然他很少抱怨
Not that he told me much about it,

但我知道他经常被欺负
but he was picked on quite a bit.

我埋头读书
So I just like read a lot of books, and

在学校里独来独往
I tried stay out of people's way during school.

他的社交活动比弟弟妹妹少很多
So his social life was much less than my other two kids,

是典型的书呆子
that's a typical nerd.

我疯狂地买连环画看
I read all comics that I could buy

还常常赖在书店看, 不打烊不离开
or they let me read at the bookstore before they chase me away.

从早到晚
I read everything I could get my hands on

一有机会我就看书
from when I woke up to when I went to sleep.

一度到了无书可读的地步
at one point I really ran out of books

只好啃百科全书
and started reading encyclopedia.

他有过目不忘的本领
And he has a photograph memory so that he could remember everything.

每当我遇到问题
Anytime I had a question,

女儿Tusk就会说: 去问天才小子
my daughter Tusk would say, "Call genius boy."

他的弟弟Kimbal Musk
His brother Kimbal Musk.

10岁时Elon参加了IBM的测试
When Elon was ten years old he got tested by IBM,

他们发现
and he was found to have one of the highest aptitude

他拥有极高的编程天赋
that they have ever seen for computer programming.

我参加了几个计算机培训班
I tried to take some computer classes

但老师的水平还不如我
but I was away ahead the teacher, so it didn't really help.

我开发了一款叫Blastar的太空游戏
So I started programming the space game called Blastar.

Musk开始像商人一样
Musk already thinking like an entrepreneur,

思考如何靠他的游戏赚钱
figured out how to sell his game.

那年我12岁
I didn't realize that till I was 12.

我们打算在学校附近开一家游戏厅
We've decided we were gonna open an arcade near our high school

我们觉得电子游戏 
we'll begin the video games,

一定会大受欢迎
we figured that, err, it was gonna be a huge hit.

我们张贴了广告 
We've got list on the building.

还找到了提供游戏机的厂家
We got the arcade provider to deliver the equipments.

最后
And the only thing we need to do by the end

只差向市政府提交申请
was to get the city to approve what we were doing.

开游戏厅必须由成年人向政府申请许可
But then adult had to apply for the city permit.

但他们一直瞒着父母
And they hadn't told their parents what they were up to.

他们说我们不能开游戏厅
of course, they told us we were not OK to open our arcade.

这孩子做的最让人吃惊的事
Really the most amazing thing of this child is

是逃离南非
his escape from South Africa.

我记得有人说过
I remembered thinking and saying, that America is where

美国是世界上最容易实现梦想的国家
great things were possible more than any other countries in the world.

听起来像陈词滥调,但的确如此
It's all cliché but it's true.

美国充满了机遇
The America is a land of opportunity.

艾伦说他想先到加拿大
So Elon came and told me that he wants to go to Canada,

然后去美国
he really wants to go to the United States.

我出生在加拿大, 可以要回国籍
As Canadian born, I can get my citizenship back,

然后传给我的孩子
and then I can pass it on to my children.

Musk拒绝在南非军队服役
Musk wanted to avoid serving in South Africa's army,

他说那是在欺压黑人
and as he put it, "suppressing black people".

在南非长大是很离奇的经历
Growing up in that part of Africa was pretty surreal.

我们不支持政府
We didn't support the government,

也不信任他们
we didn't believe in it.

所以我们绝不会去军队服役
So the idea of actually going to the military service was really out of the question.

我对父母说想去加拿大
I told my parents I was going to Canada

他们劝我留下
and they tried to convince me not to leave.

他说走就走, 让人觉得他很独立
And off he flew I thought wow he is so independent.

可刚下飞机他就打电话问我
Of course as soon as he land he called me

现在该怎么办
and said what I do now?

他囊中羞涩, 漫无目的
He arrived with little money and almost no prospects.

我搭上从Brockville去温哥华的巴士
So I rode a bus from Brockville to Vancouver

从高速公路上观察加拿大
and that allowed me to kinda see Canada at least from the high way.

他沿途做过千奇百怪的工作
He worked odd jobs across the country

最后进入多伦多皇后学院
before settling in Queens College in Toronto.

在学校时我很少去上课
In fact when I went to college I rarely went to class.

我自学完课本就去参加考试
I just read the textbook and then show up for exams.

大学最让人难忘的是追同龄女生
The big appeal university thing was to date girls at my own age.

在那儿我遇到了我第一任妻子

科技创新的第一线
the really exciting break though were occurring.

他拿到宾夕法尼亚大学的工程学和商学学位
He got an engineering and business degree from the University of Pennsylvania

还有斯坦福大学的奖学金
and a scholarship to go to Stanford.

硅谷是他朝思暮想的地方
Silicon Valley was the place to be.

Elon有很强的技术前瞻能力
Elon has this ability to look at the world

他知道20年后会发生什么
and this is a really problem that's going to happen in 20 years.

英特网, 可持续能源
The Internet, sustainable energy,

还有太空移民
and extending live beyond the making life outer territory.

我以前从没想过
Now, I didn't actually expect

要从事太空探索
to ever have the opportunity to be involved in space.

这些并不是我刻意要做的事
So this is not on the stand point of these are the things I am going to do.

我这样选择
It's from the stand point of, in the absolute;

是因为它们最有可能影响人类的未来
these are the things I think would most affect the future humanity.

Max Chafkin,《Ink》杂志的撰稿人
Max Chafkin, writes for Ink Magazine,

他在2007年和2010年
and profiled Musk in 2007, and again in 2010,

写过Musk的专栏报道
after spending several weeks with his subject.

在斯坦福
He looked around and

他期待的改变世界的事并没有发生
he saw that the world changing stuff was not happening at Stanford.

我一节课都没上
I didn't even go to class.

我打电话给系主任
I called the chair of the department

说我想开一家网络公司
and said I'd like to start an Internet company.

但我没信心
It probably won't succeed

如果失败, 我希望还能回学校上课
and so when it fails I want to make sure that I can still come back.

我的孩子经常干些稀奇古怪的事
My kids do funny things

我从来不担心
and I've never too concerned about them.

就算Elon休学,他也有办法重返学校
Because you know if Elon wanted to drop out college he could always go back.

我弟弟当时在加拿大
My brother was in Canada at that time

我劝他一起创办网络公司
and I said look I think we should try to create an Internet company.

他就来了
So he came down and joined me.

他俩举目无亲, 兜里只有两千美元
you know, 2000 dollars, no friends.

交房租都够呛
barely enough money for an apartment.

他说住的地方没有淋浴
I think he told me he was showering at the gym

只能去健身房洗澡
because they didn't have a shower where he was living.

有半年时间, 我们都睡在办公室
And we spent 6 months, sleeping in the office.

我们买了些床垫
We just got some futons that they were couches during the day

白天当沙发, 晚上当床用
and turn into beds at nights.

Steve Jurvetson, 硅谷风险投资人
Steve Jurvetson is a venture capitalist in Silicon Valley.

我第一次见到Elon和他弟弟是在九十年代中期
I first met Elon and Kimbal Musk, his brother, back in the mid-ninety's

那时他们刚来加利福尼亚
when they first set foot in California.

不到一周
I think they been here for about a week,

他们正在筹办一家叫做Zip2的新公司
and they were pitching a new company called Zip2.

九十年代中后期的硅谷是淘金圣地
Silicon Valley in the mid-ninety's and late-ninety's was like a gold rush.

人们蜂拥而至
People were flux in to the region

希望通过互联网创业致富
to find riches to make it into the Internet business.

Elon更具商业头脑
Elon was more the business master mind

我更擅长做销售
and I was more the sells guy.

我会编程
I still have my core programming skills,

第一家公司的软件是我自己开发的
so I was able to write the software needed for the first company.

别忘了Elon创办Zip2时
Now, when Elon was starting Zip2,

互联网才刚刚起步
keep in mind that the Internet was just a couple of years old.

大多数美国公司不曾接触网络
Most local businesses were not on the Internet,

查找公司信息只能翻看黄页
the way you find local business was you open up yellow pages.

1995年
It was 1995,

Musk决定把报纸引入数字时代
when Musk came up with the idea to bring newspapers into the digital age.

Elon把黄业信息刻进光盘
Elon took a CD-ROM yellow pages,

编写自动生成地图的软件
self-mapping software, wrote a little code

把它们整合在一起
and put it all together

做出了第一个在线黄页
to create the first online city listings.

我觉得媒体和报纸  
I thought it was the media companies, the newspapers gonna need help

最渴望通过网站提供各种服务
and come online and building a lot of functionality into the websites.

Zip2有点像谷歌地图的雏形
So Zip2 was sort like an early version of what we have with Google Maps.

有人扔给我们一本黄页说
We had someone literally threw a yellow pages book at us and tell us,

你们真以为能淘汰它?
do you think you're gonna ever replace this?

我们暗自发笑
And we thought the guy was crazy.

因为我们的目标
Coz not only we are gonna replace this but that's not where we gonna end it.

远不止淘汰黄页
It keeps going from there.

很快各地媒体公司纷纷前来申请注册
It wasn't long before media companies across the country were signing up.

我们赢得了客户和投资者的青睐
And so we are able to get investors and customers

纽约时报,Hearst,Knight Ridder都是我们的客户
in The New York Times Company,Hearst, Knight Ridder and all the other companies.

1999年康柏旗下的AltaVista公司收购了Zip
In 1999, the AltaVista division of Compaq bought Zip

价格是3.07亿美元外加3400万美元的股票期权
for 307 million dollar in cash and 34 million dollar in stock options.

Elon当时28岁
Elon was 28 years old.

我不敢相信
I thought that's crazy.

有人愿意出这么多钱
Why would somebody pay such a huge amount of money

买我们的小公司
for this little company that we have.

不过他们确实获得了丰厚的收益
Well, it actually turns out very well for them financially.

所以他们远比我精明
So they knew a lot more than I did.

他俩卖掉Zip2的那天太让人激动了
When the kids sold Zip2, it was the most exciting day.

毕竟互联网创业风险很大,今天资产过亿
we couldn't believe it, because you don't know in the Internet world,

明天就可能破产倒闭
if you were going to, you know, make a million or die tomorrow.

1999年Elon Musk卖掉了他的第一家公司
In 1999, Elon musk sold his first company.

年仅28岁就成了硅谷的千万富翁
In the brave new world of Silicon Valley,he was a millionaire,at the age of 28.

康柏斥重金收购Zip
Zip2 was acquired by Compaq for a little over 300 million dollars,

我个人大概赚了2100-2200万美元
I made it about 21 or 22 million dollars as the result of that,

对我来说是很大一笔钱
which was phenomenal a lot of money for me.

这显然是一笔划算的买卖
It was obvious a financial win form

我们开始购买最酷的玩意
It was super fun to go out and buy some cool toys.

这是世界上跑得最快的车
There is showing the fastest car in the world.

赚钱后他做的第一件事是买跑车
One of the first things to do is about getting the big sports car.

Musk家族素有喜爱赛车的传统
It comes from the family that really enjoys racing and vehicles.

他买了当时最贵的跑车
And he got one of the highest performance cars money could buy at the time,

迈凯轮 F
McLaren F1.

然后享受驾驶时冒险般的快感
And proceeded to enjoy that MB,let's say a number of adventures and risk-taking moves with his driving.

我想名利双收的感觉
Wow, I am sure, it felt, you know, wonderful have all these money,

一定很棒
and have people recognized his success,

但他仍然有些沮丧
I think he was also frustrated that

毕竟公司没有实现他的梦想
his company hadn't become as great as he wanted it to be,

它没有改变世界
it hadn't changed the world,

只是稍微改写了报纸的历史
it has just slightly altered the course of newspaper history,

在他看来不值一提
which I think from his point of view, it's kind of piddling accomplishment.

我可以退休, 买一个可以冲浪的小岛
So I certainly had a choice at that point of retiring and buying an island somewhere surfing my tires,

但那太无聊了
but that was not interesting at all.

毫无疑问我们会继续创业
It really wasn't a choice of we were going to do anything,

只是要考虑方向
it was just what we were gonna do next.

对Elon来说, 第一家公司只是跳板
In Elon's case particular it was just stepping stones.

他非常富有, 富到超出人们的想象
He's very rich, I mean just more money than most people could dream.

卖掉公司后
And he took almost no time

他马上着手成立日后的Paypal公司
in between that sale and starting the company that became Paypal.

第二家公司的目标
The goal was in doing with second internet company was

是要产生更深远的影响
to create something that would have profound effect.

我发现
And it seems to me

金融业存在极大的创新空间
that the financial sector not seen a lot of innovation on Internet.

钞票在数据库里仅仅是一条条记录
And money is really the entry in the database,

而且带宽有限, 看起来有创新的机会
and it's so slow bandwidth, it's seemed like something it should lend itself an innovation.

Musk的新公司创造了我们今天习以为常的事物
Musk's new company, create something we take for granted today,

它彻底改变了世界的购物方式 
it change forever the way the world buy things.

以及资金的流动方式
The way money goes from one person to another.

以前交易过程非常缓慢
At the time, transactions was very slow,

人们必须互相发邮件确认
people will have to mail checks to each other.

一笔交易要花上几周时间
So it could take weeks just to complete a single transaction.

1999年3月, Musk创办X.COM公司
In March 1999, Musk founded X.COM,

致力于实现电子现金交易
to make electrical cash transfer possible.

不久他发现竞争对手
But he discovered a rival business

也在研发类似的技术, 称为Confinity
was developing a similar technology called Confinity.

我们共同的竞争对手
And the real competing against each other

其实是eBay
and the real enemy at the end of the day was eBay.

于是我们联合起来
We combined our efforts

对抗eBay的Baltom系统
in order to compete effectively gainst eBay's Baltom system,

新公司取名Paypal
they called the new company Paypal.

Paypal的目标绝不仅仅是 
When he looked at Paypal, he's goal was not to

建立点对点的支付平台
create a place you can do person to person payment.

Elon的目标是改变整个金融行业
His goal was go to transform the financial industry.

我们做出了全球最好的支付系统
We were able to become the leading payment system in the world,

eBay被迫放弃竞争
and then eBay finally threw in the towel

并在2002年初收购了Paypal
and acquired Paypal in early 2002.

Paypal卖了15亿美元
Must and his partners sold Paypal for 1.5 billion,

Musk只有30岁
Musk's still only 30,

这次他赚了一亿八千万美元
walked away from the deal with roughly a hundred and eighty million dollars.

我可以买下一群岛屿
I could afford honestly a chain of islands,

但我还是不感兴趣
but again, that was not interesting to me.

接下来做什么呢?
So what next,

最前沿的领域
the final frontier

太空
space.

Elon从小对太空着迷
He is always been obsessive,

他的游戏Blaster
even his computer game Blastar

就是太空飞船射击邪恶的外星人
was about space, Spaceship shooting Astros and evil aliens.

人类的未来依赖于我们对其他星球的探索
It's just much more exciting inspiring future for us exploring stars,

否则我们将永远困在地球上
as opposed to the future where we are forever confine to earth.

一旦有了新奇大胆的想法
He had what might seem a completely absurd notion

他马上会展开行动
that he just soon he could pull off.

我很想知道
I was thinking, I wonder

美国航空航天局计划何时登陆火星
when we're going to Mars, when NASA's going to Mars,

可我在他们的网站上没找到去火星的计划
and I went to NASA website, there is no plan go to Mars,

也没找到任何探索太空的计划
and no plan to really even take the next step as the space exploration.

Elon想探索火星
As Elon saying, he wants to go

让人类有可能离开地球
and enable the human civilization to leave the planet earth.

这是超级大胆的设想
It's about a big vision you could possibly imagine

需要巨额资金
and that's going to require funds,

他有这个经济实力, 决定放手一搏
and he has enough funds to do it, so he's gonna do it.

他的想法令人吃惊
He had an outrageous idea,

仅凭私人企业的力量实现太空旅行
that a private enterprise could actually reenergize space travel.

2002年6月,太空探索技术公司SpaceX成立
In June 2002, he founded space exploration technologies or SpaceX.

公司成立时, Elon是唯一的出资人
Elon was the only funder of the company for its early years.

这是一步险棋
Another incredibly risky move, to say,

没人相信他能独自支撑下去
nobody in the planet think this idea is financialable,I'm gonna fund all of it myself.

为了梦想
Took two of almost hundred million dollars,

他投资了近两亿美元
and which was majority as that worth of the time, into a dream.

他承担了本该由美国军工体系承担的任务
to take on the military industrial complex.

你瞧一个南非移民
now this immigrant from South Africa come to America to say, you know,

居然瞧不起美国航空航天局
NASA that whole rocket thing you do with space shuttle,

声称要另辟蹊径, 从头做起
I got a better way, let's move it all to a new design that I'll build.

简直是冒天下之大不韪
and you know you'll fight country's feeling left and right,

可这家洛杉矶的新公司正在这么做
and here is a startup, trying to build them in Los Angeles.

但是洛杉矶无法提供他需要的所有东西
But Los Angeles didn't have all the parts he needed.

我去了三趟俄罗斯
Actually I travelled to Russia 3 times,

寻找翻新的洲际弹道导弹
Looked at ____ refurbished ICBM, ____.

这事挺滑稽的
It was odd going to Russia,

一个普通美国人跑去莫斯科
you know like a random American South Africa guy

等着购买洲际导弹
shows up in Moscow waiting to buy refurbished ICBMs.

我们在莫斯科看到许多莫明其妙的地方
We visited some weird places in Moscow,I don't know,we went to one place looked like...

我说不清他们在做什么
I don't know what they did there.

去过三趟后, 我对要做的事有了信心
After the third trip, I actually had learned more about the space business,

我发现
and I came to a conclusion that

美国60年代探索太空计划受阻的原因
the thing that was really holding us back from making much more progress in space

是没有充分利用火箭技术
was really that rocket had not involved in 1960's.

发射火箭进入地球轨道并不难
So the trick isn't figuring out how to get to orbit,

难的是如何控制成本
it's figuring out how to get to orbit cheaply.

我一方面要控制
So I had to come up with low cost way

引擎,电子设备,发射平台的研发经费
to produce engines, the primary structure, and electronics to launch operation,

另一方面要控制公司的运营开支
as well as run the company with very low overhead.

借鉴已有的技术 
And the sum of inventions in all those areas is what has let us to

我们节省了大约三到四倍的火箭研发成本
roughly three-to-four-fold improvements of the cost of our rockets in the US.

SpaceX成功是因为
What SpaceX has been very successful at is taking basically off-the-shelf technology,

借鉴了美国航空航天局的现成技术
stuff that was developed by NASA 50 years ago,

并加以简化
and streamlining it

Elon就像太空领域的享利福特
So in that way, he's kind of Henry Ford of space,

汽车不是福特发明的
because Henry Ford didn't invent automobile,

他只是发明了商业化批量生产汽车的方法
he just figured out how to make the automobile commercially viable.

Musk是全能型的企业家
But Musk was more than just an entrepreneur.

虽然Elon不是航空工程师从身
Elon wasn't trained as an Aeronautical engineer,

但是他有很强的学习能力
and yet he's had the ability to be very successful in that particular space.

他深度参与公司产品的设计和制造
He's deeply involved with product architecture design and engineering,

尤其是SpaceX
more so with SpaceX, but with all of his companies.

我问Elon是怎么学会航空知识的
If you asked Elon, how he managed to teach himself rocket science,

他严肃而平静地告诉我
he just look at you very seriously, and just say very quietly,

我读了很多书
I read a lot of books.

32岁那年,尽管仍然对火箭和跑车着迷
At age 32, though still fascinated by rockets and fast cars,

Musk决定着手结束人类对石油的依赖
Musk was more dedicated than ever,to ending the earth addiction to fossil fuels.

新点子是在一年一度的家庭旅行中形成的
He had his next big idea, as his family's annual visit to Burning Man.

Burning Man是Musk大家族最喜欢的活动
The counter-culture desert happening is the favorite rendezvous for the extended Musk family,

Elon的堂兄弟也创办了自己的公司
including two cousins who will follow Elon and his brother from South Africa, and who have started a few companies of their own.

我把进军太阳能领域的想法告诉堂兄弟
I just want to address the idea of going to the solar power arena to

Linden和Peter
Linden and Peter Right, my cousins.

他想像戴尔电脑那样制造太阳能板
He's got this idea that we gonna make Dell Computer but for solar panels.

把屋顶太阳能板的安装变得极其简单
We gonna make this really really easy for anybody to install solar panels on their roofs,

Elon把想法告诉堂兄弟
and basically hands this idea to his cousins,

如果他们愿意开公司, 他可以投资 
and says if you want to start this, i will fund you

条件是由他担任董事长
and it will be your company but I'll be the chairman.

他们同意了,新公司运转得非常顺利
And they say, OK, and it works almost perfectly.

他们希望
What they figured out is that

通过降低用户安装太阳能电池的难度
if you sort of do a hundred things ten percent better in the area of solar cell installation for homeowners,

将全美国的屋顶都利用起来
you can dramatically consolidate industry, currently a bunch of Mom and Pop shops.

SolarCity免费为用户安装太阳能电池
So SolarCity dare to say how about no money done,

不收取任何费用
you want solar cells, we just put them in, you don't pay a cent.

有点像租车, 但是更划算
Right? Like leasing a car, but even better.

尽管只在西部五个州开展了业务
Working in just 5 western states,

SolarCity已经成为美国最大的太阳能供应商
the company became the largest solar service provider in the US,

每个月承接500个新项目
installing 500 new projects per months,

Musk将来很可能成为美国绿色能源的老大哥
with the potential to make Musk the top supplier of green energy in the country.

等租期结束,SolarCity将拥有这些太阳能板
If solar services keep going, SolarCity then owns those at the end of lease.

从长远看
So the fascinating business mode in the long term

SolarCity会成为美国最大的屋顶能源生产商
they may become the largest energy generator in America of all of these roof-tops.

生产再生能源只是第一步
Renewal energy, it's just phase one.

第二步是生产Tesla
Stage two, Tesla,

第一辆可长途行驶的全电动跑车
the first viable long-distance fully electric car.

他想生产电动汽车 
He had his idea he wanted to make electric cars

帮助人类摆脱对石油的依赖
help humanity get off fossil fuels.

他发现程序员Martin Eberhard和推进系统专家JB Straubel
He discovered that computer engineer Martin Eberhard and hyper propulsion expert JB Straubel

正在研制电动汽车
were working independently, also trying to build an electric car.

发展可持续能源
To get a sustainable energy future,

不仅要生产能源, 还要使用能源
we must have both sustainable energy creation and consumption.

SolarCity生产能源  
So SolarCity is about sustainable energy creation,

而Tesla使用能源
well Tesla is about sustainable energy consumption.

2004年4月
In April 2004,

Musk投资630万美元成立Tesla公司
Musk helped launch Tesla with 6.3 million dollars of his own money.

结束了汽车产业数十年无新公司成立的状态
It's the first auto industry startup in decades,

这也是硅谷第一家汽车公司
and the only one born in Silicon Valley.

我们资金有限 
And it's really pretty simple,

所以计划很简单
it's, you know, make a high price car at low volume,

先少量生产豪华电动跑车
because that's essentially only thing we could afford to do.

然后适量生产中档价格的电动汽车
And then step two, is a medium price car at medium volumes,

最后大量生产经济型电动汽车
and step three is low price car at high volumes.

像首部移动电话和苹果电脑一样
Like the first mobile phones or Apple computers,

Tesla决定先推出高端产品刺激消费需求
Tesla decided to introduce a high end, high performance product first.

再推出经济型产品
Then, when everyone wanted one, they make it affordable.

我们期待这辆车改变人们对电动汽车的成见
We expect to change the way that people think about electric cars with this car

为销售经济型电动汽车开辟市场 
and that we hope to open a market for us to sell other electric cars.

这是人性使然,如果一开始推出经济型电动车
But we also know that if you started by saying let's first change human nature,

那肯定行不通
make everybody drive economical cars, that doesn't work.

与其造一辆普通的电动汽车
So Instead of build a car people want to drive,

不如造一辆高端豪华跑车
let's build a car just hot and desirable and beautiful,

让大家知道驾驶电动汽车绝非折中之举
and convince people that driving an electric car is not a compromise.

利用高端汽车
Its idea of actually going in, and putting in a high end car,

破除大众对电动汽车的成见
and breaking the mode of what an electric car was,

这主意太棒了
was exciting.

我们要做的不是高尔夫球车
This is no longer gonna be a golf cart.

而是法拉利
This is gonna be a Ferrari.

- 路上有条子吗? - 没有,畅通无阻
- Any cops watching?  - No. Coast is clear.

第一次见到Tesla
When we first saw Tesla,

我们就明白了它轻易打开市场的原因
it had a good explanation for how they get to market without having spend exorbitant amount money,

以及它的品牌定位和产品诉求

整个项目运作得天衣无缝
And each part of the story click together.

都是硅谷的技术, 不是底特律的
those are the skills presented in Silicon Valley and not presented in Detroit.

采用计算机电池作为汽车动力
Tesla's revolutionary technology

是Tesla的革命性创新
started with a computer battery as the power source for automobile.

它是第一辆可以行驶200英里以上的电动车
For the first time, it was possible to drive over 200 miles,

其表现足以媲美燃油汽车
and have performances that was directly comparable, competitive with what a gasoline car can do.

Tesla是第一家将这些理念付诸实践的公司

电动汽车的设计关键是扭矩
An electric car is designed by, is all about torque,

高扭矩才能瞬间提速

踩一下油门就能绝尘而去
So you can step on it and haul ass.

州长施瓦辛格亲自出席了Tesla的发布会

迪卡普里奥和乔治克鲁尼也买了
So did Leonardo DiCaprio and George Clooney.

但普通消费者能接受Tesla吗?
But could Musk sell regular consumers on the idea?

大众对电动汽车仍抱有成见
The electric car still have an image problem.

老天! 快关掉, 我被电到了
Oh, God, turn it off! Ah! I've been electrocuted.

当时电动汽车产业毫无生气
At that time there was very little activity in the auto industry in electric vehicles.

市场的宠儿是SUV
We were in the age of large SUV.

一家加州公司计划推出高端电动跑车
So it was a little unusual to hear about this company in California

确实出人意料
that was planning to come to the market with a high end auto electric sports car.

JB Straubel是Tesla的技术主管

挑战科技的极限
this car was going to throw down the gauntlet and what the technology could do.

向世界证明
And really prove to the world that

电动汽车可以实现长途和高速行驶
electric vehicles, you know, could be incredibly fast and could have incredibly long range.

第一个吃螃蟹总是需要极大的勇气
It was a kind of sensitive adventure, you know, doing this thing for the first time

何况我们只有两个人
and doing it in a very scrappy way.

第一批电池和零件是在车库里做的
We did some of the very first battery packs in my garage and other parts

我们甚至没有像样的办公室
before we actually were able to rent a real office.

电动汽车的瓶颈是电池

美国消费者已准备好接受电动汽车
American consumers are very ready for battery electric vehicles,

问题是电动汽车还没准备好
unfortunately, battery electric vehicles aren't ready for American consumers.

Tesla似乎印证了这令人沮丧的预测
The first result at Tesla seemed to support this gloomy forecast.

刚开始研发Tesla时
Tesla, when we first started out,

我们的想法很简单, 也过于乐观
the thought was simple and really optimistic, that quite naive,

以为借用莲花汽车的底盘
which was to make use of Lotus Chassis,

以及从AC Proportion购买的技术
some technology that we developed by ourselves,

加上我们自己的技术
but also some technology that we licensed from AC Proportion,

就能生产出电动跑车
put that together and creates an electric sports car that would be compelling.

问题出在哪呢?
So, let's see, where did it fall apart?

Tesla团队许诺单台车生产成本是6.5万美元
The car that Musk's team told him could be made for 65,000 dollars

结果仅原材料成本就达到14万美元
would actually cost 140 thousand, Just for raw materials.

我们发现成本远远超出了预算
when we found out the cost were a lot higher than we expected.

这非常让人沮丧
It was a very frustrating time for us.

Tesla的问题不断积累
As the problem mounted,

Musk面临着生死抉择
Musk faces a Do or Die decision at Tesla.

是解散公司, 还是追加投资
Would he let the company collapse or invest his next stake,

拿卖Paypal赚的1亿6千万美元冒险
the 160 million dollar fortune he made from the sale of Paypal.

Tesla到了生死关头

2007年Tesla的资金即将耗尽
By 2007, Tesla was running out of money fast,

没人愿意挽救前景不明的汽车公司
no one want to step up to save the unproven automobile startup.

Elon只能独自面对困境
Elon had to take the leap alone.

公司发生了剧变, 尤其是资本变化
we faced some pretty dramatic changes, essentially recapitalized business,

我们增加了两倍的投资
and invest about twice what we have originally expected,

远远超出最初的预算
what we originally expected was the outer limit.

Elon说梦想还在
And Elon was looking at this and saying: The dream is still there,

但我必须要回公司的控制权
but, oh my gosh, what have I got? I gotta get this under control

剩余资金
Basically Tesla got to this point where they

只够Tesla维持一两个月
only have enough money in the bank for a couple of months

没人愿意投入更多的资金
and there is nobody around who are willing to put more money in.

我把自己剩余的资金全都投给了Tesla
I took all of my reserve capital and invested into Tesla,

想起来还让人后怕
which was very scary because, You know, it will obviously be quite sad

毕竟这些钱都来之不易
to have the fruits of my labor with Zip2 and Paypal not amount to anything.

但我已下定决心
But there is no question that I would do that in my own mind,

因为Tesla太重要了
because Tesla was too important to let die.

我任何时候都有空,有问题直接找我
I am available 24/7 to help solve issues,

就算凌晨三点也没问题
call me at 3 AM on Sunday morning, I don't care.

我们必须调整公司高层人事
We had to go in and made some really hard decisions on personnel changes,

Elon把他的时间都留给了公司
and Elon really had dedicated his time to the company.

所有人要各司其责
I want names named.

如果有人身居要职却总惹麻烦
So if someone always on the hot seat and it's always the root cause for problems,

他就待不长了
they would not be part of this organization for a long term.

如果他在这里不能开心工作
It is not ok to be unhappy in part of this company,

就请他另谋高就
if somebody can't get happy, get divorced!

Musk和董事会辞退了Martin Eberhard
Musk and his board replaced Martin Eberhard,

Tesla的创始人之一
one of their co-founders

他一直掌管着公司
who has been running Tesla.

Tesla已经超出了Eberhard的管理能力
And I think we kinda have really exceeded the level that Eberhard could handle.

这一点在2007年变得非常明显
and that became apparent in 2007.

要么公司关门大吉
We either gonna have to shut the company down,

要么让Elon出任CEO
or Elon has to take over CEO.

组建公司和研发汽车是同时进行的
It is actually a process of building a company as well as building a car.

有些人在公司规模不大时干得如鱼得水
You know, a lot of people that fit in very well with the company when it was extremely small.

但公司变大后却找不到位置了
It didn't end up fitting in as well when it was larger.

Eberhard不服气
Eberhard didn't go quietly.

他控告Elon诽谤和违约

希望与戴姆勒-梅赛德斯结盟以募集资金
with a scheme to raise extra cash by forging an alliance with Daimler Mercedes.

戴姆勒公司发明了内燃机汽车
Daimler is company that invented inter combustion engine car,

是梅赛德斯和Smart汽车的制造商
the maker of Mercedes, Smart,

他们的担保很有份量
and their endorsement carries a great deal of weight.

此行事关重大
So that was just a really important moments.

他要证明Tesla可以为戴姆勒供应电池组
He had to convince the company that Tesla could supply battery packs for Daimler's cars,

可惜他的PPT演示不奏效
but his PowerPoint demo failed miserably.

戴姆勒希望看到实物展示
The really the key thing with Daimler was to demonstrate a hardware that worked.

他们不相信看不见摸不着的东西
You know, if they can't touch it, they can't drive it, it is not particularly real.

为了让德国人相信电动汽车的潜力
To convince the Germans of the potential of the electric car,

他要求团队把电动发动机移植到Smart上
he asked his team to retrofit a Daimler Smart car with Tesla's electric motor.

把Smart改装成电动车非常不易
The challenge of converting a Smart car to electric was doubly difficult.

首先Smart根本不在美国销售
because we couldn't find a Smart car. The Smart car was not for sale in the United States.

我们不得不派人去墨西哥买一辆带回国
so we have to send somebody down to Mexico to buy a Smart car and bring one to the U.S.

其次Smart体积太小
And then, the Smart car is really tiny

这增加了移植发动机和改装电路的难度
so we had to fit a motor, power electronic and charger and everything into a Smart car.

这项挑战令人生畏
The challenge was daunting:

把Tesla的电池和传动系统
To replace the Smart car's gas engine with a Tesla drive train and battery

塞进Smart狭小的空间
fitted in a tiny space under the hood

而且只有四周时间
and do it all in less than four weeks.

我们一开始就知道时间有限
We didn't have much time at all, we knew that from the beginning

只能全力以赴, 车间弄得像战场一样
and we kinda prepared for almost a battle, you know, set up a war room in the shop.

他们夜以继日工作
They work around the clock.

困了就睡在地板上
Stealing naps on the factory floor.

直到完工
Right up to the deadline.

戴姆勒高层来了
The Daimler executives arrived

他们压根不信任美国汽车公司
and not at all convinced that they made any sense to work with an American car company,

更别提一家硅谷的小公司
let along this little tiny American car company in Silicon Valley.

戴姆勒的人出去试车
The Daimler executive went for a test drive.

回来时态度完全变了
When he came back, a breakthrough

双方签订了7000万美元的合同
A 70 Million dollar contract

由Tesla为电动版Smart制造电池
for Tesla to make electric Smart car batteries.

这给了Musk信心生产中等价位的轿车
This gave Musk the confidence to start building a competitive priced sedan.

他称之为Model S
He called it: The model S, taking his cue from the original Model T.

定位在时髦的家用轿车

我们请来Henrik Fisker
Originally with the Model S,

设计 Model S
we thought let's have Henrik Fisker who had a design studio do the styling

付给他一笔可观的费用
we paid him a pretty good sum of money to do that.

但他的设计让人大失所望
Curiously enough the design that he worked on that he came up for us was terrible.

他没有告诉我们
And what he didn't tell us was

私底下他正在筹办自己的电动汽车公司
that he was actually working on a competing car company.

Tesla声称Henrik来Tesla
Tesla officials claimed that perhaps Henrik had come in

是为了偷学技术
to learn what Tesla was doing

他自始至终都在计划成立自己的汽车公司
while all along he was planning to form his own company, do his own vehicle.

他窃取Model S的技术资料
We are pretty upset with him for basically taking

利用它拉到投资,生产相同的电动车
what were at the time the original specification for the model S,

实在是小人行径
and then shopping a business plan to create that same car.

Tesla起诉他, 他反诉Tesla
Tesla sued him and he sued Tesla,

双方展开一场混战
and there was all kinds of, you know, in-fighting.

Henrik Fisker拒绝接受彭博的采访
Henrik Fisker wouldn't grant Bloomberg an interview.

但他表示
But he told us that

他相信市场有足够的空间容纳几家
"I believe there is enough space in the market for several new car companies

采用一种新电动传动系统,但理念不同的公司
that pursue a new type of electrified power train with different philosophies".

2008年,法庭做出了有利于Fisker的裁决
In 2008, the court ruled Fisker's favor.

虽然对Musk来说只是个小挫折
It was a minor setback for Musk.

但这却是他噩运年的开端
But the beginning of what would turn out to be the hardest year of his life.

无论是事业还是婚姻
It is always difficult to find the right partner,

都很难找到合适的伙伴
in business or in one's personal life.

你的选择不可能总是正确
And you don't always make the right choices.

Musk的个人生活并非一帆风顺

感觉自己像个花瓶
And, you know, it's kind of referred to as a trophy wife feeling.

Justine当庭拒绝了Musk提出的赡养协议
Justine challenged the settlement offered by Musk in court

并公之于众
and went public.

Justine接受《Marie Claire》《泰晤士报》的采访
Justine takes her story to the Marie Claire magazine, the Times of London Newspaper,

还撰写了博客
and her own blog.

2011年3月29日
On March 29th 2011,

Justine宣布接受1000万美元的赡养费
Justine announced that she was accepting the settlement for 10 million dollars

数目比Musk之前的提议还要少
less than what Musk offered before she took him to court.

离婚后我的个人生活有些混乱
I got divorced, personal life in somewhat of shambles.

媒体利用我前妻的事攻击我
And in addition getting, you know, attacked by some of the media about my ex-wife,

用辞非常恶毒
every bad thing you could imagine.

出现各种莫明其妙的报道
There were all kinds of crazy allegations around that,

都是空穴来风
you know, allegations about the affair, which have never been substantiated.

与此同时,SpaceX没能成功将火箭发射到预定轨道
Meanwhile, SpaceX, Musk's other company, hadn't been able to get a rocket into orbit.

他说有能力承担3次失败
He started saying, "I've got enough money for three cracks at it."

他已经投入了1亿美元
And he put a hundred million dollars of his own money

如果3次还不成功
and he sort of hinted the idea that

就只能放弃
after 3 if he didn't make it, it would be over,

关闭SpaceX

第二次发射进入了太空
the second flight actually did make it into space,

但没能进入预定轨道
but not to orbit.

第三次发射也没能进入轨道
And then also flight three, wouldn't get all the way to orbit.

Musk投入SpaceX的1亿美元已经耗尽
Musk had already burnt through the 100 million dollars he has sunk into SpaceX.

现在一切又回到了起点
Now he was on his way back to the drawing boards.

发射失败后第三天
Three days after the failure,

他宣布知道问题出在哪里了
he announced, like, first that he knew what was wrong.

他决定继续筹集资金
He announced that they'd raise money

为几个月后的第四次发射做准备
to finance the fourth launch, and the fourth launch was gonna happen in a matter of months,

如此频繁地发射火箭, 简直闻所未闻

我们已经知道怎么解决问题

正在这时

and closed Tesla's branch in Detroit.

真的很艰难
That was tough,

连通用汽车和克莱斯勒都破产了
it's obviously an economic period that sort of bankruptcy of General Motors and Chrysler.

何况我们只是一家小众的汽车公司 
And that we were a young company selling a very optional car,

这关头谁还需要十万美元的跑车?
I mean it was really, who will need a hundred thousand dollars sports car?

这还不是最糟的
But things would get even tougher.

他的能源公司SolarCity

我没想到
I suddenly did not anticipate

公司只剩维持一周的现金, 甚至还不够

2008年马上就过完了
I mean there were like 2 or 3 percent state left in the year.

我从来没想过我有可能失败
I never thought it was possible for me to have those break down.

但那一次确实很危险

险些就前功尽弃
That was about as close as that gonna come.

他告诉我有时他半夜醒来
He told me that he was waking up in the middle of the night,

我的心都揪紧了

真希望他早日走出低谷

and he proposed at the end of that 7 days.

是不是不可思议
strangely, to gain a relationship,

我们见过对方最糟糕的状态
But you know, we said to each other, we've seen each other are very very worst.

所以我们的感情更加牢固
You know, and through that our love has managed,

而且越来越好

Musk的个人生活有了起色
Musk's personal life was looking up,

但公司的命运仍然前途未卜

我必须做出选择
I had to make a choice then,

要么把剩余的积蓄都投进Tesla
that either I took all of the capital that I had left from the sale of Paypal to eBay,

要么关闭Tesla
and invest that in Tesla, or Tesla would die.

公司已经走到了悬崖边上
