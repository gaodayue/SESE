Tips for Reading Report Assignment

*	Reading Report \- a critical evaluation of what you read

  
It is not only a concluding summary but a critical evaluation of your reading work. It contains the main points of the writing piece, along with your own reflective post\-reading thought. 

*	Components of a Reading Report

	-	title / author / source of reading, etc. 

	-	**A concise summary** of the reading piece, providing an overview of what it actually concluded.

	-	**A brief critique** of the reading piece, giving an evaluation of the piece, and this should be as much critical as you can.

*	The concise summary 

	The summary should not include details or examples that appear in the article unless a general concept cannot be understood without an illustration of what is meant, of course, the summary should be written in your own words to demonstrate that you have understood the article. 
	
	You should never copy sentences directly from your reading. Because a summary is a miniature version of the original reading, you should not express your opinion about the subject. You will have the opportunity to do this in the Critique section.

*	The brief critique 

    A brief critique of your Reading Report gives you the chance to express your opinions, ideas, or reactions to the information you have acquired in that reading. Avoid responses like "I liked the article" or "I don't agree with the author." If you want to express an opinion about the article, explain why you liked it or why you don't agree. 

*	How to write a reading report

	1. In order to write a good reading report, you must have read the paper critically.
  
	2. If you don’t understand a passage, read over it again; if it still leaves you clueless, read on.
  
	3. When you write up your report, keep this in mind. Be concise. Concentrate on the main points but show how they connect \– instead of writing down a list of interesting points, the use of linkers such as **however**, **therefore**, **in addition**, **besides** illustrates how an argument is structured.

	4. Once you have an idea of what the piece is about, it is time to make notes. Try to stay focused on what is really necessary to understand it. 

	5. Treat this as a practice of writing \— write it on a computer so that you can edit easily and also for legibility.
