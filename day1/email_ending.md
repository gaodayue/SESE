	-	Close your letter with a polite “thank you” if you wish to express your gratitude to the recipient of the letter.
	-	If you are writing a letter to someone close, then end your letter with “love”. This will help you to show the recipient how much you care about him/her.
	-	Typically a letter is ended with a farewell expression, followed up a comma, and then the name or signature of the person who is writing the letter.
	-	When writing an informal letter, it is alright to capitalize both the words in the ending. For example, “Warm Regards” or “Best Wishes”.
	-	If you are writing a letter to a close relative, then an informal ending works better than a formal ending that would sound emotionally distant.
	-	If you are writing a letter to someone you are not familiar with or know a little about, it can get a bit tricky when closing the letter. You neither want to appear formal nor too distant. In these situations you can use certain phrases like “all my best”, “ regards”, “cordially yours”, “best”, “all my regards”, “warm regards”, “talk to you later”, etc.
